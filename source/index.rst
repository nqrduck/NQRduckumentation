This program is intended as an educational tool for magnetic resonance experiments (NMR, NQR, ...). Its focus lies on modular behaviour depending on what nqrduck modules are installed. 

The core of the program is the nqrduck. It provides a central interface for communication between the different modules. The nqrduck core loads all the installed modules in your python environment.

The focus for spectrometers currently lies on LimeSDR based spectrometers (LimeSDR USB, LimeSDR Mini 2.0).
